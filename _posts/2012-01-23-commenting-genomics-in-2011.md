<p>Today is my first day of classes and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=8XOPyM4AAAAJ&amp;oi=sra">Kasper</a> couldn&#8217;t have had a better timing to share the link to <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/12/137">Genomics in 2011: challenges and opportunities</a>. There, the Editorial Board members of Genome Biology gave their opinion on: important 2011 papers, influential people for their careers, advice to young scientists, top challenges in their field, and unlimited money projects. I felt identified several times and as:</p>

> <p>I think one of the most important skills in research is the ability to communicate ideas. [&#8230;] practicing both writing skills and oral presentation skills.</p>

<p>here I am sharing my view on the paper.</p>
<p>Overall the paper is a good read and I enjoyed most of it, so I highly recommend reading it.</p>
<p>The top papers section is quite broad and it felt to me like a huge abstract on many papers. Now I want to read the paper on &#8220;phenologs&#8221;, a concept that seems very simple and natural, and has helped understand a bit more what genes do (functional genomics).</p>
<p>The parts about influential people and unlimited money projects are not so interesting. I felt that it was too personal and I didn&#8217;t feel that it related to me much. Regardless, I&#8217;d like to highlight some parts of the text:</p>
> * [&#8230;] showed me the fun of methodology development in computational biology
> * [&#8230;] emphasized establishing a solid foundation in computer science and statistics but also developed our skills to identify relevant and impactful biological questions
> * His humble upbringing, ability to admit when he was wrong, and persistence for what was right has continued to inspire me.
<p>The advice section was very appealing to me and I felt reassured as some of the advice I gave even younger scientists (<a href="http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/13739343319/introducing-biostatistics-to-first-year-lcg-students#.Tx3PlmPOz_g">check my talk to LCG students</a>) popped up. I surely learnt a few things too =)</p>
> * Surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you also helps you raise your game.
> * Published is better than perfect.
> * Importance of communication
> * you need to appreciate the biology as much as, if not more than, the statistical method or computer science
> * The success of our field is ultimately measured by the impact we can have on our understanding of biology
> * I would say it&#8217;s the ability to understand both the experimental and the computational sciences. [&#8230;] I would learn the key principles in computational biology or at the very least the linguistics, and vice versa.

<p>I hadn&#8217;t taken consciousness of the fact that the amount of computing you can do (per dollar) is doubling every year while the size of genomic databases is going up by a factor of 10. I knew something was off and that we are getting more data, but I didn&#8217;t know the ratio. Plus, I have to agree with the comment that cloud computing is not going to be the solution though I&#8217;m not sure if:</p>

> The only solution is to discover fundamentally better algorithms for processing these databases.

<p>Sure, we need better algorithms, but I think that it&#8217;s fair to ask for cleaner and higher-quality data. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the data format has to be simpler, as:</p>

> Far too often, enough biological details are abstracted away so that the solution loses its biological relevance.

<p>Sad, but true.</p>
<p>I do agree with:</p>

> Another challenge is to educate people about genomics and to tone down the natural hype of the genomics field.

<p>Just as with any discipline, it&#8217;s not easy to explain your field to a random person and it&#8217;s a harder job when someone exaggerates a set of results.</p>
<p>The argument that RO1 NIH grants are not built for young genomics scientists is interesting and I do hope that it changes soon. Though I don&#8217;t have a clue as to how the following is going to happen:</p>
> the last challenge is to transform the academic review system in our institutions</p>
> Understanding the systems-level ecological rules governing microbial community structure<
<p>surely opened my eyes as it was one of my main interests a few years ago (and stills interests me ^^).</p>
> streamlining methods for turning next-generation data into actionable biology
<p>sounds very fancy!! It&#8217;s as fancy, and important, as developing new ways to visualize networks that take into account time instead of viewing all the possibilities at once.</p>
<p>To finish off the post, I agree completely with:</p>
>I believe the biggest bottleneck is the bioinformatics and the shortage of researchers in the field. There needs to be a big investment to address this shortage. 
<p>Note that I think that there are lots of bioinformatics-converts: people who recently joined the field to fill in the gap in their lab. As:</p>
>In my opinion, too many computational biology researchers are working in isolation on marginally relevant problems or making incremental improvements in areas that have already been well-populated by methods that are already adequate. 
<p>So, yes, we need more bioinformaticians as most labs have high-throughput experiments (with only one experiment you already need a bioinformatician), but I do hope that a good proportion of them are trained to develop methods and focus on important problems and new areas instead of marginally relevant ones on &#8220;old&#8221; areas.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m studying a PhD in Biostatistics!</p>
