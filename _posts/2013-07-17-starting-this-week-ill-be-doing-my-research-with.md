<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/47201742" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><br/><p>Starting this week, I&#8217;ll be doing my research with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (<a href="http://www.libd.org/">LIBD</a>) as <a href="http://www.libd.org/contact/staff-directory?query=jaffe">Andrew Jaffe</a>'s first Ph.D. student there. My main advisor will continue to be <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/">Jeff Leek</a> which is great for me. I&#8217;ll have access to massive data sets at Lieber and will face the challenge of integrative genomics. That will be fun, exciting and challenging!<br/><br/>Here&#8217;s a short video explaining what the LIBD is about and why Baltimore is a growing city.</p>
