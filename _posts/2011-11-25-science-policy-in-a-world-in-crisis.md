<p>I recently read an interesting commentary piece stating thatÂ <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/science-s-attitudes-must-reflect-a-world-in-crisis-1.9419">Science&#8217;s attitudes must reflect a world in crisis</a>. I have mixed feelings from such a statement. In one side, I think that freedom in research is important as new findings in basic science will make it to applied science at some point and such a workflow is needed. Yet, I also understand the point that many products derived from science are too expensive for the gran majority of people in rich countries, and more so in developing countries. In this sense, I agree that science needs to realize what is going on outside it&#8217;s bubble and shift towards helping all of us. Is it idealistic? It certainly is as a big chunk of applied science is funded by large corporations aiming at big earnings. Also, I don&#8217;t see which government policy would help in making this shift in attitudes. I guess that at big start would be to facilitate the interaction between a researcher and engineers, and making clear the role of the researcher in these scenarios to avoid any conflicts of interest. At least, in Mexico it&#8217;s quite blurry the path a researcher in a public university has to follow to get his idea into a product.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I recommend reading the commentary piece and invite you to think which way science should go in this world whether in crisis or not.</p>
