Yes, they use the &#8220;800-pound gorilla of semiconductors&#8221; instead of organic materials. The other key part is that they use magnesium instead of other metals like copper. Magnesium is more reactive and thus can degrade (or be assimilated) once the silicon shell dissolves producing true biodegradable electronics. The neat part is that they can actually control how long it takes for these electronics to degrade.</p>
<p>This field looks very promising! But now they need ideas (specific applications) to test in more detail their electronics. If you have one, let them know!</p>
