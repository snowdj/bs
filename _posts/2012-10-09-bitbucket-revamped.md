<p>Bitbucket announced their new &#8220;look&#8221; today. The goal is to make it more team friendly but I guess that they also wanted to make it look fresh.</p>
<p>For example, the overview page now has a quick summary:</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbn7ffEV281qfs0hy.png"/></p>
<p> That can be useful coupled with the simpler navigation tabs. But I think that the best of the new tools is the ability to comment at a given commit at any line change.</p>

<p>This gives a new dimension when working with a team. It&#8217;s independent of the version control system you are using, so this can be a drawback in a sense as you need to log into Bitbucket to see the comments. I guess that if you keep the main explanations inside commit messages, this new comment tool can be helpful when reviewing the code and/or solving merges.</p>
<p>Bitbucket thought about how to make these comments more visible, so they show as updates in the overview page. That&#8217;s great, otherwise you would have to go to each commit and check if there is anything new out there. Plus, there is an RSS feed for those of us that prefer to use these instead of browsing to a webpage to check if there is an update.</p>

<p>To foment the discussion when solving merges, they also have some new tools inside the &#8220;pull requests&#8221;:</p>

<p>Overall, these changes make me happy and want to stay with Bitbucket. Though most of my collaborators use Github and the idea of having to get a new account is a HUGE wall. You wouldn&#8217;t think it is after having accounts for lots of other stuff, right? </p>
<p>Well, remember that you can log into Bitbucket using OpenID:</p>
