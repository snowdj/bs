<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/opinion/sopa-boycotts-and-the-false-ideals-of-the-web.html">The False Ideals of the Web</a><br/><p>This is a very interesting blog post as it portrays a different view in the whole Internet companies vs Copyright holders fight. It&#8217;s worthwhile reading as you&#8217;ll learn some basic facts which are not frequently shared. For example, it sounds obvious that Facebook is trying to create a new Internet that Google can&#8217;t access. Yet this is not something you hear often, or at least I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I agree with the statement that:</p>
> The inevitable endgame was always that we would lose control of our own personal content, our own files. We haven&#8217;t just weakened Hollywood and old-fashioned publishers. We&#8217;ve weakened ourselves.

<p>It&#8217;s quite a powerful statement! I think that more and more people are starting to read the terms of usage for sites before using them. Though it&#8217;s also true that you renounce to many things if you stay updated. It feels to me that the author is eager to mix the fight for privacy and the much more publicized fight between Hollywood and Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><br/>Here are some other blog posts I read on the SOPA subject that you might find interesting. Though this one clearly set a different tone.</p>
