<iframe width="400" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0VfeGLxUlU0?rel0" frameborder="0" ></iframe><br/><p>I think this might be a bit old for some (it&#8217;s from 2009) but damn! This picture looks amazing! The video is kinda boring and you really won&#8217;t feel impressed until you go and see the picture for yourself <a href="http://www.dresden-26-gigapixels.com/dresden26GP">here</a>. Obviously, your screen won&#8217;t be able to display it completely, but just navigating through it will feel great. Then you can zoom into some details and just say: wow!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
