<p>Just a quick change to Fellgernon Bit. I removed the endless scrolling from the blog because it was looping posts infinitely when browsing a tag as <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/">Roger</a> noted. It&#8217;s likely that there is a small bug on the html code, but I&#8217;m not going to look for it anytime soon.</p>
