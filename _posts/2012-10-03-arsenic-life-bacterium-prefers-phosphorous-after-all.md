<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/arsenic-life-bacterium-prefers-phosphorous-after-all-1.11520">‘Arsenic-life’ bacterium prefers phosphorous after all</a> by Daniel Cressey summarizes a recent paper where it&#8217;s shown that GFAJ-1 will use phosphorous over arsenate even when phosphorous is very rare in relation to arsenic. </p>
<p>GFAJ-1 is the <em>weird bug</em> I talked about in <a href="http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/14131921454/genome-of-controversial-arsenic-bacterium-sequenced#.UGyfQfl26lo">Genome of Controversial Arsenic Bacterium Sequenced</a> at the end of 2011. The whole story is interesting from the point of view of reproducible research. Obviously, the whole idea of DNA with arsenate instead of phosphorous was a huge bomb that attracted lots of attention. However now:</p>

> <p>The exceedingly high preference for phosphorous found in the key proteins in that species represent “just the last nail in the coffin” of the hypothesis that GFAJ-1 uses arsenic in its DNA, says Tawfik.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that it will be the last paper on GFAJ-1, but the controversy should be over now.</p>
