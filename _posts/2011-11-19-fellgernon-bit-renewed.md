<p>I&#8217;m glad to announce that I just renewed <em>Fellgernon Bit</em> as I plan to use it to pretty much share my comments on anything I stumble upon that I find interesting. Note that I&#8217;m definitely not leaving the great Salmoblog project, which I enjoy reading. It&#8217;s just that these two blogs satisfy different needs. You don&#8217;t need to look further away than to note that they are in different languages.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the <em>Fellgernon Bit</em> going to be about? I can try to convince you that it&#8217;ll be about X, Y, Z but time will tell. My goal though, is to share my opinions to my friends and anyone who wants to read them, and to allow this to happen I need to write my posts in English. I also don&#8217;t feel that Facebook/Twitter/Google+ is going to cut it. Sure, I&#8217;ll use them to announce posts but after using Google Reader for a while I&#8217;m convinced that blogs offer an interesting option. So at least I want to try it out and see what happens.</p>
<p>I do have plans to include some R-related stuff in the future once I start doing more research here in my PhD. I&#8217;m specially interested in Bioconductor and teaching new users, which is something that you can trace to my R-roots when I started using it in Mexico. </p>
<p>I also think that it&#8217;ll be easy to start discussions involving people from all of my social networks and random browsing-visitors.</p>
<p>So, welcome to <strong>Fellgernon Bit</strong></p>
