<p>That was the headline of a recent post in <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/12/genome-of-controversial-arsenic.html?rss=1">ScienceInsider</a>. If you don&#8217;t know, GFAJ-1 is the name of a bacteria that cause controversy in the microbial research world around a year ago. The eye of the hurricane is the claim that GFAJ-1 is able to substitute phosphorus by arsenic. Phosphorus is one of the four main elements needed for life and it had never crossed our minds that arsenic could sustain life by replacing phosphorus. It&#8217;s the kind of story line you would expect from a sci-fi movie set in a distance galaxy.</p>

</ul><p>Yet, just like in recent science controversial topics, there is a group of researchers supporting the claim, a group that criticizes the methods the first group used, and a vast majority of incredulous observers. The team that carried out the genome sequence is part of the second group, and so far, the genome has been like more wood for the fire. Why? Well, GFAJ-1&#8217;s genome codes for less arsenic-resistant genes that other famous microbes like <em>E. coli</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m part of the group of incredulous observers though if proven right, this finding would be the first one of an alien-like type of life that NASA is looking for. On more solid ground though, this controversy did fuel the discussions on open science (check out <a href="http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=454">An informal definition of OpenScience</a>). So far I&#8217;m not sure if I support open science since I fear that it would become something like a social network. But don&#8217;t fool yourself thinking that it is hard-math: science already is highly social!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely not the one most informed on the subject of GFAJ-1, but if you want to learn more I recommend reading:</p>
