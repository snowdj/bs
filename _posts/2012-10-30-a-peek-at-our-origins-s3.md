<p>A good month ago we started the latest pin map in our department. I say latest because it has been done before and at some point that no one knows, the pins willÂ disappear. Anyhow, I was playing around with it and trying to color code the pins according to the flags. In the case of the US I also tried the common blue/red representation for democratic and republican states.</p>

<p>I love the two green points :)</p>
<p>I should get an updated picture since it has a lot more pins now.</p>
