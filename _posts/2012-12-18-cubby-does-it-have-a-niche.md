<p>So today I got an invitation to install <a href="http://www.cubby.com">Cubby</a> in my computer. It looks like another Dropbox service, but what really attracted my attention is the &#8220;make a folder a cubby&#8221; feature. This allows you to select any folder and get it synched into your devices through the cloud. At least for me, this gives Cubby an important niche. I don&#8217;t know about you, but well, there are some things that I just don&#8217;t want to organize inside my Dropbox or Google Drive or whatever other similar service&#8217; main folder.Â </p>
<p>An specific example is my research code files. I keep them in a simple to get to directory since I use the terminal a lot. Sure, I can have an alias to go to change directories into my main research directory. But well, now I can leave them be and simply mark them for cloud synchronization with Cubby. Note that my main cloud service for research code files is Git/Mercurial repositories with Bitbucket (Github works too) because the commit messages are a must.</p>
<p>Cubby has another attractive feature (paid though) which they call DirectSync. It allows you to sync an unlimited amount of files between computers without keeping a copy in the cloud. Plus they have a security feature (paid as well).</p>
<p>The starting package is the standard: 5 free GB. Plus 1GB for every referral.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see if Dropbox and others change to include features similar to &#8220;make a folder a cubby&#8221; or if this will give Cubby a niche.</p>
