<p>I think that I like the idea of moving to bit.ly Well, moving might be an understatement. So far, I&#8217;ve been using the regular bookmarks and bookmark folders in Firefox and Google Chrome. But I&#8217;m beginning to see the advantage of using bit.ly Sure, getting numbers on who accesses you public bit.ly&#8217;s can be interesting. But whether you keep them private or public, I think that the big advantage is writing those notes to annotate your bitmarks (aka, bookmarks). That&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t have with regular browser bookmarks.</p>
<p>I think that I&#8217;ve also been twitting more by sharing the bitmarks that I make and find interesting to share. I think that <a href="http://bit.ly/12vVmbp">Hilary</a> would agree with me when I say that this is more &#8220;human&#8221; than simply using Twitter to be your PR machine. After all, I write those notes in my bitmarks myself.</p>
<p>Plus, the bit.ly page looks nice and simple.</p>
<p>Here is my bit.ly profile <a href="https://bitly.com/u/fellgernon"><a href="https://bitly.com/u/fellgernon">https://bitly.com/u/fellgernon</a></a> It&#8217;s still rather short.</p>
