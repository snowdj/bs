I hadn&#8217;t thought about the message you could be sending depending on which cheek you show. I had only noticed that people like to show more serious-looking photos of themselves and sometimes make it an obviously funny one. I have to say too that some of the pages from my co-workers don&#8217;t even show a picture. I guess that&#8217;s a more recent trend to make it more &#8220;professional&#8221; looking. Dunno.</p>
<p>I have to guess that dead center-looking pictures are rare. At least when you look at <a href="http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/staff/index.php?id=RJ002">Rachael Jack&#8217;s one</a> it stands out. It reminds me of passport pictures. For my <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/index.html#.UD-xBmie5us">new academic site</a> I choose one that doesn&#8217;t look serious, I wanted a fun one! Plus I make it obvious which country I&#8217;m from ^^.</p>
<p>For some reason this doesn&#8217;t surprise me:</p>
