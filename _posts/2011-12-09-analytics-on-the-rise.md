<p>IBM just <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/ibm-buys-demandtec-for-440-million/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">bought today a company specialized in cloud computing analytics </a>(which is really statistics) for $440 million <strong>in cash</strong>. I laughed at the cash part :P but the point is that big companies are buying all the medium ones that excel in analytics of massive data sets. Meaning that these companies most likely have some experience dealing with the cloud. So, as it&#8217;s being said in different posts in <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/">SimplyStatistics</a>, it&#8217;s a great time to be involved in statistics and computing. At least you know that jobs offers will be around once you finish studying (alas, it&#8217;s a long road).</p>
