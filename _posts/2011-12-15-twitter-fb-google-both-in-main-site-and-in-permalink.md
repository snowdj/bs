<p>Yes, I should be studying, but then again, I wanted to improve the part of sharing posts in my blog. So with the help of ShareThis, specifically <a href="http://sharethis.com/publishers/get-button-code?platform=1&amp;five=true&amp;buttons=%7B%22twitter%22%3A%5B%22vcount%22%2C%22Tweet%22%2C%22%22%5D%2C%22email%22%3A%5B%22vcount%22%2C%22Email%22%2C%22%22%5D%2C%22facebook%22%3A%5B%22vcount%22%2C%22Facebook%22%2C%22%22%5D%2C%22sharethis%22%3A%5B%22vcount%22%2C%22ShareThis%22%2C%22%22%5D%2C%22plusone%22%3A%5B%22vcount%22%2C%22%22%2C%22%22%5D%2C%22fblike%22%3A%5B%22vcount%22%2C%22%22%2C%22%22%5D%7D">this url</a>Â which has the settings I chose, I added the capability to share via email, Twitter, Google+, FB, FB like, ShareThis for each post from the main page and from the permalink page for each post. It&#8217;s very easy and much looks ok. It definitely was easier than I thought as you simply post the part 1 of the code before the {/block:Posts} tag.</p>
<p>Ok, back to studying.</p>
