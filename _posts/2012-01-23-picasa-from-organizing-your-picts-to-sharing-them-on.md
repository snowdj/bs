<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve talked about how much I like using <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>. The desktop application is great! When you set it up, it quickly finds all your pictures in your computer. Then it becomes easy to organize them into folders by using drag-and-drop with the zoomable previews. But the best part comes when you start using it with <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com">Picasa Web Albums</a>. </p>
<p>You can sign into your Google account from Picasa and start uploading your pictures to the web. Note that it comes with 1 free GB of storage, which is not much. You can pay 5 bucks to upgrade it to 21&#160;GB for a year, but either way you&#8217;ll have to think how you want to upload your pictures. Picasa allows you to upload smaller versions of your pictures in different sizes up to 2048 pixels, which in my opinion is more than you&#8217;ll need for regular pictures. Sure, if you plan on printing a poster or something big, you&#8217;ll want to upload the original size pictures. In my case, as I don&#8217;t have that many pictures I decided to upload the original size ones. Plus, it&#8217;s great to have your pictures backed up on the Google servers &#8220;cloud&#8221;. To upload your pictures I highly recommend using the &#8220;Tools &gt; Batch Upload&#8221; tool, though you can also upload them folder by folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CrZkrobojys/Tx4nCjH6vpI/AAAAAAAATEA/2fGzdUbigMA/s400/Screen%252520shot%2525202012-01-23%252520at%25252010.34.29%252520PM.jpg"/></p>
<p>Once you have decided which size you want to upload your pictures, it&#8217;s important to choose the visibility. I personally don&#8217;t ever use the &#8220;public on the web&#8221; option because it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I know, not the best argument, but it&#8217;s what it is. However, I do like the &#8220;anyone with the link&#8221; option if I plan to share the folder with anyone in particular: friends, family, post on a blog.</p>
<p>Note that Picasa Web Albums is very much in synch with <a href="https://plus.google.com">Google+</a>, which is good and a bit bad. The good part is that it&#8217;s easy to then share an album with specific &#8220;circles&#8221; such as the family one. The bad part, is that if you tag someone in a picture, they get access to the entire album where the picture is located. Picasa has a decent face recognition set of tools, but I do not want to go and split albums into pictures I want to share and pictures I don&#8217;t want to share. Anyhow, the share setting is changed to &#8220;anyone with the link&#8221; if you share the album to Google+ from Picasa Web Albums.</p>
<p>Picasa (Preferences &gt; Web Albums) has the option to avoid confirming every single sync, which I like to keep checked as I have some picture folders synched to the web versions. The watermark option can be attractive to use if you plan on widely sharing your pictures but want to include a copyright notice. </p>
<p>The watermark option is a great choice if you plan on sharing large versions of your pictures. But I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s necessary if you are sharing smaller versions like in your blog posts. <a href="http://ortuzarm.com/">OrtuzarM</a> once told us that it&#8217;s unlikely that people will reproduce small-size pictures.</p>
<p>For instance, when I upload a picture to my blog, I upload it first to Picasa Web Albums into a folder with &#8220;anyone with the link&#8221; setting on. Once I locate the picture of interest in Picasa Web Albums, I click on &#8220;link to this photo&#8221; which is on the right sidebar. Then I choose the &#8220;Medium-400&#160;400px&#8221; size and click on the &#8220;Image only (no link)&#8221; box. The URL on the &#8220;Embed image&#8221; box is the one I use to share via blogs. As far as I know, this URL cannot be used to track down the &#8220;Link&#8221; URL which is the Picasa Web Albums direct link to the original picture you have on the web.</p>

<p>You can also set the &#8220;Photo reuse&#8221; setting as shown in the above picture. Basically, you can keep all the rights to yourself or allow reuse through the Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you should definitely give Picasa a try, specially if you like Google products. That&#8217;s because Picasa is great for having your pictures in a messy organization and still having them all in one site with a &#8220;search&#8221; function. Though, as I said before, you get the most when you use it with Picasa Web Albums.</p>
<p>PS. I can&#8217;t wait until Picasa allows direct sharing to your Google+ circles instead of having to do so through Picasa Web Albums. Picasa allows direct sharing with Google Contacts groups, which I personally no longer maintain in shape.</p>
<p>PS 2. I&#8217;m posting this now instead of adding it to the queue (4 posts in a day!) to share it with the new bloggers in my family ^^</p>
