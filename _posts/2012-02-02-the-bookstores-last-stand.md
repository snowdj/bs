<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/business/barnes-noble-taking-on-amazon-in-the-fight-of-its-life.html">The Bookstore’s Last Stand</a><br/><p>This is an interest report on why the book industry depends so much on the success of Barnes and Noble, the last big bookstore chain. Which, surprisingly to some, is second to Amazon on e-readers with its Nook device.</p>
<p>The future doesn&#8217;t look good for Barnes and Noble, and one thing that surely comes to my mind is the price difference. I&#8217;m also surprised that this topic didn&#8217;t show up in the report, but the price and delivery speed are great features that Amazon offers. This is specially true if you have Amazon Prime, which is free to students for some time. Also, I like how easy it&#8217;s to find sellers of used books in good shape through Amazon. That&#8217;s why I ended up buying this term&#8217;s book there. Sure, school books is just a part of the market, but again, the price difference can be huge!</p>
<p>So, all in all, I wouldn&#8217;t bet on Barnes and Noble future. Even if I like the stores. And it would surely suck if you are stuck behind them. Or is there something that I&#8217;m missing?</p>
