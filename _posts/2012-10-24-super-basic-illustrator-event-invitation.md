<p><a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/people/student/mejia.shtml">Amanda</a> and I are organizing a cultural student mixer for students in our department. One of the things we needed to do was invite everyone to attend. I like using computers, but graphic design is not something that I&#8217;m too excited about, but I still wanted to try something out.</p>
<p>My goal was to show an image of a bowling lane where the Earth (as the ball) knocks down &#8220;statistical pins&#8221;. We recently covered least squares in our class, so I felt that the analogy of &#8220;minimizing our cultural differences&#8221; fit perfectly. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Photoshop in the past, but after reading (or parts of) <a href="http://www.dreaminfinity.com/nocturne/2010/10/photoshop-illustrator-or-indesign/">Photoshop, Illustrator, or Indesign?</a> by Chris Takakura I decided to use Illustrator. The first thing I tried to do was to crop the Earth from the following image which I found using Google Images with the &#8220;large&#8221; option (I didn&#8217;t want small pics that would look bad if enlarged).</p>

<p>But it turns out that you don&#8217;t &#8220;crop&#8221; in Illustrator. You use &#8220;clipping masks&#8221; as explained <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/319423">here</a>. It took me some time to figure this out, but it was easy once I used the &#8220;ellipse tool&#8221;. I was expecting a visual shape, but I got a circular &#8220;path&#8221;.</p>
<p>Next, I found a good bowling lane image:</p>

<p><a href="http://hankmemoir.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/bowling-a-strike.jpg">Source</a></p>
<p>With this, it was easy to &#8220;place&#8221; the image (I found the term from <a href="http://www.dreaminfinity.com/nocturne/tutorials/illustrator-tutorials/placing-images/">this tutorial</a>). After resizing everything and moving the Earth image to the front (arranging it), I followed this tutorial to place text on a path. This was quite easy. </p>
<p>Finally, I just wanted to add a green checkmark for the drinks + snacks + beers message. That was easy using the following image:</p>

<p>After some revisions, the end result was the following ad which we sent via email to the other students:</p>

<p>This is as far as my graphic design (well, putting together) skills go :P</p>
