<p>Checking the <a href="http://www3.clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://fellgernon.tumblr.com">ClustrMap for Fellgernon Bit</a> I realized that there have been 2 recent tweets with geo-tags enabled. Both made reference to <strong><a href="http://paper.li/omckelligan/1306861732/2012/01/29">Mexico Review&#8217;s January 29 issue</a></strong> where my post on quesadillas is quoted ^^. <a href="http://paper.li/omckelligan/1306861732">Mexico Review</a> is a newspaper published by <a href="http://paper.li/~/publisher/482152#tab=created">Mexico Weekly</a> using the <a href="http://paper.li/">paper.li</a> web tool. I didn&#8217;t know such a website existed which is like a blog platform for posting re-blogs in a news website format. It sure looks interesting and a competition to mainstream media, which is quite manipulated in Mexico (and probably in the whole world). paper.li seems to be the best option for people like Mexico Weekly with the following motivation:</p>

> <p>How to understand México? Especially if this place has the worst press that can be gathered. I have the advantage of belonging to both cultures, let me guide you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I like the amount of ads though, but with 2000+ tweets the site surely has an audience of its own. I feel that it&#8217;s a similar effort to what a few friends and I are carrying out @ the <a href="http://salmoblog.org/">Salmoblog</a>. </p>
<p>In the end, I&#8217;m happy that there are more non-mainstream media efforts out there. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
