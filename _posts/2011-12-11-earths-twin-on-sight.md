<p>A short time ago, NASA&#8217;s KEPLER team announced that they had confirmed the existence of a planet similar to Earth in terms of surface temperature and distance to it&#8217;s own star. We don&#8217;t know yet whether it&#8217;s a rocky planet with water or ice in the surface or a gas-filled planet. </p>

<p>What I find quite interesting is that this is only the first of many planets KEPLER has marked as potential Earth-like planets. Also, 21 degrees (celcius) surely looks attractive and whenever light-speed travelling is in the table, Kepler 22-b is just 600 years away. Perfect for a vacation when you&#8217;ll need to escape the cold in climate-changed Earth. Delusions? Who knows :P but I know for sure that I&#8217;m flying to Mexico to escape part of the winter :)</p>
<p>Anyhow, if you might want to read more on Kepler 22b at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16040655">BBC</a> and/or <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/12/potentially-habitable-planet-is-.html">Science</a></p>
