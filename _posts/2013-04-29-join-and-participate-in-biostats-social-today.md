<p>¡Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I hope you had a great time this weekend, at the retreat or elsewhere. Now that the department is hyped up with plenty of new ideas and things to do for the self-study and beyond, I think that it&#8217;s a great time to remind everyone about <a href="http://tinyurl.com/biostats-social">Biostats Social</a>.</p>
<p>At it&#8217;s bones, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/biostats-social">Biostats Social</a> is just a private Google Group. But overall it provides us with a space to share things, interact, and socialize with anyone linked to the Department (staff, faculty, postdocs, students of all flavors). It&#8217;s this big melting pot of people that makes <a href="http://tinyurl.com/biostats-social">Biostats Social</a> a great place!</p>
<p><span>The Google Group infrastructure allows you to choose the mode that you like best: a mailing list, weekly email reports, no emails and thus browser-only access, etc. </span></p>
<p>The policy is simple: opt-in. To do so, go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/biostats-social">tinyurl.com/biostats-social</a> and request to join (this helps us keep outsiders at bay).</p>
<p>Best,</p>
