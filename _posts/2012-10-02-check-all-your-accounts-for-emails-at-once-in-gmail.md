<p>Do you use Gmail as your primary email account? Primary, what? Well, I&#8217;m sure that you have your personal account somewhere and your work or university account too. You can either log into each email interface or you can integrate them to a single one.</p>
<p>Gmail makes this easy as you can go to the &#8220;Settings -&gt; Accounts and Import&#8221; to set up Gmail to pull all of your email into it. In that same page you can configure Gmail to send email through your work/university accounts or at least camouflage it. </p>
<p>That is all great, but as you will soon learn, Gmail pulls the emails from your other accounts at random intervals. It tries to do so in an intelligent way by pulling more frequently during the times of the day that you get more emails from those accounts. But you&#8217;ll soon realize that some emails get pulled an hour later.</p>
<p>Maybe this is what you want. Specially if you get TONS of emails and you don&#8217;t want anyone to expect immediate replies from you, thus promoting more intelligent emails from them and hopefully reducing your email traffic load.</p>
<p>But maybe you don&#8217;t like this behavior. That&#8217;s where the &#8221;Multiple Inbox&#8221; Google Lab comes in.</p>

<p>You can find it by going to &#8220;Settings -&gt; Labs&#8221;. &#8220;Multiple Inbox&#8221; is designed to help those that have multiple Gmail accounts. But it also changes the behavior of the &#8220;refresh&#8221; button. </p>

<p>Once you enable &#8220;Multiple Inbox&#8221;, the refresh button will automatically look for new emails in ALL of your accounts. Thus you will no longer have to go to &#8220;Settings -&gt; Accounts and Import&#8221; to manually look for new emails by clicking on the &#8220;Check mail now&#8221; links. </p>
<p>Note that &#8220;Multiple Inbox&#8221; creates automatic <em>panes</em> if you are using the default inbox. If you don&#8217;t like them, you can simply go to &#8220;Settings -&gt; Multiple Inbox&#8221; and clear the default searches.</p>
