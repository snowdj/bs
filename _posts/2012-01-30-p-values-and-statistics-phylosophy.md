<p>I&#8217;m in the process of catching up with all the posts from <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com">SimplyStatistics</a> that I didn&#8217;t read during the break. Doing so I found a very interesting post on p-values (more below)</p>
<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15402808730/p-values-and-hypothesis-testing-get-a-bad-rap-but-we">simplystatistics</a>:</p>

> <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">p-value</a> is the most widely-known statistic. P-values are reported in a large majority of scientific publications that measure and report data. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">R.A. Fisher</a> is widely credited with inventing the p-value. If he was cited every time a p-value was reported his paper would have, at the very least, 3 <strong>million</strong> citations* - making it the <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/280/28/e25.full#">most highly cited paper</a> of all time. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s like <strong>the p-value is a necessary evil</strong>. The post is indeed a great read, but what caught my attention was the following statement:</p>
> <p>The advent of new measurement technology has shifted much of science from hypothesis driven to discovery driven making the existing multiple testing machinery useful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking a class with <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~crohde/personal/">Chuck Rohde</a> on probability with a strong philosophical component. That lead me to ask him recently how he would try to convince a biologist that he should believe/trust statistics. To explain myself a bit more, I asked the question as I&#8217;ve been in environments where people follow their intuition on what is significant or not and disregard whatever statistics says on the same data. So in the past I&#8217;ve been in discussion where I&#8217;m the one trying to convince others that statistics say something is not significantly different. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that I communicated my question correctly as Rohde&#8217;s answer is that whenever he says a +- on count data we (as statisticians) are not doing something right! He also reflected on the past as at some time people were quite into mathematical biology, a field that has either died out or transformed into new fields (systems biology comes to mind). Will the same happen to genomics? *Sound of a coin flipping in the air* I don&#8217;t have a clue!</p>
<p>In a sense, the post at <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com">SimplyStatistics</a> approaches the same issue I was trying to ask Rohde:</p>
> <p>Why not explain to our collaborator that the observation they thought was so convincing can easily happen by chance in a setting that is uninteresting. [&#8230;] In general, we find p-value to be superior to our collaborators intuition of what patterns are statistically interesting and which ones are not.</p>
<p>To end the post, I invite you to read the paper <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692458">A Brief History of the Hypothesis</a> by David Glass and Ned Hall from back in 2008. It&#8217;s one of my all time favorites. I&#8217;ve read it a few times and while my memory distorts what they really wrote, in my mind it&#8217;s a great summary with a message: it&#8217;s time to abandon hypothesis-driven science and continue with question-driven science involving building models from data and not from our hypothesis. </p>
<p>Here are a few quotes from their paper:</p>
> <p>We propose that building hypotheses should be abandoned in favor of posing a straightforward question of a system and then receiving an answer, using that answer to model reality, and then testing the reproducibility and predictive power of the model, modifying it as necessary.</p>

<p>They end their paper with:</p>
> <p>Thus, although a hypothesis might have been thought to be necessary in the past, it no longer seems to be so. It is better to see science as a quest for good questions to try to answer, rather than a quest for bold hypotheses to try to refute.</p>
<p>Do you agree?</p>
