<p>It&#8217;s been a few days since I last wrote a post, mainly due to finals week but also because of the beginning of vacations. Anyhow, as you might have noticed, I&#8217;ve been playing around with widgets and improving <a href="http://fellgernon.tumblr.com">Fellgernon Bit</a>'s social connectivity. I'm satisfied with how it looks now though I might need to work on faster load times.</p>

<p>So one of the first changes I made was to add my Twitter profile on the right sidebar by following <a href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/widgets/widget_profile">Twitter&#8217;s instructions</a>. That was quite simple and I only had to play around a bit to resize the window. </p>
<p>Next, I was inspired by <a href="http://salmoblog.org/">Salmoblog</a> to add social buttons on the main page for each post. At Salmoblog though, currently the only button is the &#8220;facebook like&#8221; one. I don&#8217;t like the idea of showing only one option for visitors, and I had seen the ShareThis button in a few places. That&#8217;s why I went ahead and added it as I explained on a <a href="http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/post/14273440005/twitter-fb-google-both-in-main-site-and-in-permalink#.TvK_GSPOzIw">previous post</a>. The way I see it, the advantage of using a service like <a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> is that they are able to track all the social actions, which would not be the case if you manually add the Twitter button, Facebook Like, Facebook Share, Google+, and other buttons. </p>
<p>However, I was not super happy with the way the buttons looked. So I started browsing around for other options and found <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">AddThis</a>. Immediately I searched for AddThis vs ShareThis information and found a <a href="http://www.twobitoperation.com/blog/addthis-vs-sharethis/">nice short post explaining current simple differences</a>. Overall, AddThis and ShareThis seem to have pretty much the same functionality. Plus, they both seem to be under constant improvement. However, three current facts sold me into the idea of changing to AddThis:</p>
<ol><li>the buttons look better with AddThis</li>
<li>AddThis affects the load times of the page less than ShareThis</li>
<li>the &#8220;facebook like&#8221; button was not working with ShareThis (if you clicked it, the facebook interfase would show up briefly and close automatically). Note that you need to <a href="https://www.addthis.com/help/third-party-buttons#facebook-like">add a specific line of code near the top</a> of the html file so AddThis can count the number of &#8220;facebook like&#8221; clicks.</li>
</ol><p>I also like the new feature from AddThis where if anyone does a copy-and-paste on the url of the site a small tag will be added at the end which allows AddThis to track this type of event sharing. Also, it&#8217;s quite easy to <a href="http://www.addthis.com/help/google-analytics-integration#.TvLBeSPOzIw">integrate Google Analytics with AddThis</a> so that you can use the former to track all the social events.</p>
<p>Just like with ShareThis, AddThis is easy to add yet I ended up reading quite a bit to understand how to customize it and finally to make it look like I wanted to. </p>
<p>If you are going to add AddThis buttons to your blog/site, note that <a href="https://www.addthis.com/get/sharing#.TvLFsiPOzIw">they recommend</a> using addthis_button_preferred_1 instead of specifying the specific buttons you want to show up. If you do so, the buttons will be different for each user and they will vary according to what AddThis knows from each user sharing-trends. I decided not to do so for Fellgernon Bit because I want specific services to show up, but also because with the AddThis button and AddThis count bubble, the top options will be those customized to each user. So, it all seems to fit nicely and I&#8217;m giving the visitor all the options he could want.</p>
<p>So, following their <a href="https://www.addthis.com/help/third-party-buttons#.TvLGuCPOzIw">help site</a> for third party buttons, I added Google+, Tumblr, Email via AddThis, AddThis button, AddThis count bubble, Tweet, Facebook Like buttons.</p>

<p>As they recommend, it&#8217;s useful to load the AddThis script in the head part of the html code so it will only be loaded once and not many times. Still, the load times are not as fast as I would like because and that is certainly due to AddThis retrieving all the information for the most recent posts.</p>
<p>Once I was done with these changes, it was straight-forward to update the right sidebar using AddThis. </p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rd8VUhVyBHE/TvLDWZupZrI/AAAAAAAARoc/HX591_FwWRU/s800/Screen%252520shot%2525202011-12-21%252520at%2525208.17.02%252520PM.jpg"/></p>
<p>To complete the sidebar, I added a Google+ badge to my profile, a twitter follow button, and a &#8220;facebook like&#8221; button (via AddThis to track all social events as I said before) to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fellgernon-Bit/266730316715060">Facebook page I created for Fellgernon Bit</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yeUcWDXrPcQ/TvLDUNQdVTI/AAAAAAAARoc/7itKTc9YQpw/s640/Screen%252520shot%2525202011-12-21%252520at%2525208.06.48%252520PM.jpg"/></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to talk about <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> more, but basically I&#8217;m using it to allow email subscriptions to Fellgernon Bit. This feature is in the &#8220;Follow and Share! =)&#8221; section of the right sidebar.</p>
<p>I also completely changed the search bar at the top by replacing it with a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/">Google Search bar</a>. This involved a tiny bit of CSS tweaking which took me some time as I don&#8217;t really know CSS (so lots of trial and error). The previous search bar wasn&#8217;t working as is the case in most Tumblr blogs. The Google CSE is the slowest one of the widgets I added in terms of loading speed, but at least it&#8217;s useful which was not the case.</p>
<p>Finally, I added a <a href="http://clustrmaps.com/">ClustrMap</a> to the right sidebar. I&#8217;ve used it before in some sites I made years ago and they look nice. I was also surprised by the new features like the small blinking yellow dot showing where you are visiting from. </p>
<p>With all these additions, I&#8217;m happy with the way the blog is socially connected now. The only detail I&#8217;m missing is automatic posting to my Google+ profile as each post is thrown into my Twitter account (which shows up in my Facebook one) through FeedBurner and not Tumblr. I did so because FeedBurner adds the Tumblr tags as hashtags to Twitter which Tumblr doesn&#8217;t do. Also, everytime I write a new post, it shows up in the Fellgernon Bit facebook page (through Tumblr this time). So now you can subscribe to Fellgernon Bit via Twitter, Facebook, RSS (FeedBurner), email (FeedBurner), and Google+ (with some manual input from my part so far :P).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m nearly done with the set up phase, but as I said earlier I now need to work on improving the load times.</p>
