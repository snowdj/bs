<p>I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;<a href="http://bit.ly/12vYvIh">Inbox Zero for Life</a>" strategy for a few weeks, and I think that it&#8217;s been payed off for me in this short span.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s stated in that long guide, one of the major concerns you might have is that it could end up as just changing a current problem for another one. I think that so far, that hasn&#8217;t been the case for me. Sure, my starred emails is not 0, but it stays at a steady number and doesn&#8217;t increase as my inbox (even with priority inbox) did.Â </p>
<p>I also have a few filters in place that pick up the emails that I will most likely never read. For example, advertising emails and school wide announcements.</p>
<p>One point I&#8217;m not sure that I buy is the whole psychological effect of having an empty inbox. But whether or not that&#8217;s true, I certainly didn&#8217;t know that the gmail app in the iPhone/iPad has a weird smiley that looks like a sun telling you something like: &#8220;Your inbox is empty. Have a nice day!&#8221;</p>
<p>Credit goes to <a href="http://bit.ly/12vVmbp">Hilary</a> for finding telling us about this strategy.</p>
