<p>I recently read the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-meet-capitalists-1.9512">Scientists, meet capitalists</a> commentary by Eugenie Samuel Reich where he talks about a new attempt at bridging science with industry. I do think that we, as scientists in general, don&#8217;t receive training on how to make this connection. Back when I represented my undergrad class, I did once propose a course where we would learn:</p>
<ul><li>the basics of applying the scientific results and getting together the elements that would make it easier for others (specialized in transferring technology) to complete the chain of events. I think that some love doing basic research, but if you can just the overall job easier without major time consumption, more people would do it. I don&#8217;t know the answer on how to teach this, but a panorama shot would have been useful.</li>
<li>the basics of applying for grants. Just like publishing your work, applying for grants has it tweaks and even a short series of talks by faculty members on their experience could have been useful.</li>
<li>the basics of publishing your work on a scientific journal. Clearly a good skill to have as a researcher.</li>
<li>I would now add basic tips on reproducible research.</li>
</ul><p>The idea got shot down because it wasn&#8217;t clear who would be able to teach us such a course, plus the headmaster was trying to cut down the number of courses.</p>
<p>Anyhow, reading the commentary by Eugenie I noticed that I&#8217;m not sure if making the Science-Industry connection a widespread practice is feasible or not. After all, the point made by Waverly Ding is valid:</p>
> But younger scientists have a harder time raising capital, and taking time away from research is less likely to benefit them, she says
<p>In the end, I feel that if specialists in translational research can come up with a format / database  / tool where basic science researchers can deposit their findings in a way that makes it easier for them to continue the cycle, the Science to Industry connection would become a widespread reality. Training researchers and forcing them to become translational research specialists doesn&#8217;t seem to be the answer.</p>
