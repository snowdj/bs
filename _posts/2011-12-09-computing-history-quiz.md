<p>Do you know the history of computing? Well, I thought that I knew the basics but it turns out that I need a refresher. I invite you to take <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15952227">this simply 7 question quiz</a>. It&#8217;s more on general knowledge than the actual history of computing, but is still fun.</p>
<p>Once you take it, you might feel like I did with all the acronyms in computing. For instance, Pizza is a language? What? It&#8217;s creators obviously liked it too much!! I do too, but I&#8217;m not naming anything Pizza!</p>
