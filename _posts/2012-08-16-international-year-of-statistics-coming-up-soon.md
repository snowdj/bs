<p>Did you know that next year will be the International Year of Statistics? Well, you probably didn&#8217;t! There is a <a href="http://statistics2013.org/index.cfm">site</a> organizing the activities and listing the institutions that morally support the celebration. I&#8217;m happy to see my current work place listed there but at the same time concerned that the National Autonomous University of Mexico is not in it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s not that surprising since there is no big Statistics department at UNAM. Googling I found a <a href="http://www.dpye.iimas.unam.mx/">Department of Probability and Statistics</a> listing 14 faculty members and it seems that it was last updated in 2007. Not looking good! There is a more <a href="http://www.dcb.unam.mx/CoordinacionesAcademicas/CienciasAplicadas/ProbabilidadEstadistica/index_eng.html">recent site</a> listing 3 staff members and it seems to be geared towards helping students. I did find a graduate program on <a href="http://www.iimas.unam.mx/iimas/pagina/es/110/posgrado-en-ciencias-matematicas-y-de-la-especializacion-en-estadistica-aplicadaes">Mathematical Sciences specializing in Applied Statistics</a> and a short diploma course on <a href="http://www.educontinua.fciencias.unam.mx/SiteNuevo/Cursos/DiplEstadProb/2012/Intro.php">Probability and Statistics</a>. I think that most statisticians at UNAM work in institutes without Statistics in the name. I hope that there are plenty more out there!</p>
<p>There are several other Mexican institutions listed (just look at the <a href="http://statistics2013.org/participants.cfm">participants list</a> and search &#8220;Mexico&#8221; in your browser). Looking at the list highlights how vastly spread is the field. By that I mean that there are plenty of organizations across the world that teach it, and use it. I&#8217;m also happy to see that most of the activities (which are almost exclusively conferences) are not in the US. I&#8217;m sure that by 2013 there will be plenty more activities listed and hopefully some public outreach events.</p>
