<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about commenting papers in blog posts. I did a <a href="http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/tagged/Paper%20comments#.UT534NHF0W8">few some long time ago</a>, but now I&#8217;m thinking of doing this activity more systematically. There are several reasons why I&#8217;m thinking of doing this, say for 1 paper a week. It has the obvious advantage of forcing me to read a paper in depth per week. At the same time, I want to learn more from others. See what I like in other papers and maybe avoid some mistakes. There are two main lines of papers that I would be posting about. Anything that is somewhat close to my research (genomics, RNA-seq, biostatistics, bioconductor, visualization) and anything done by my undergrad peers from <a href="http://www.lcg.unam.mx/">LCG-UNAM</a>. I don&#8217;t think that there is a compilation of papers from LCG students despite many of us doing research all over the globe —Mexico, US, Canada, Denmark, France, England, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Australia to name a few countries. Maybe compiling a list of papers with contributions from LCG students is a task for <a href="http://masciencia.org/">Más Ciencia por México</a> which seeks to promote science in Mexico. But I would be happy to learn what others are doing and in a way keep in touch academically. </p>
<p>Another reason in favor is that blogging helps me practice my English. And writing helps me organize my ideas.</p>
<p>But, the question remains, if you systematically comment papers, what would you comment on?</p>
<p>I think that I should state my opinion of the paper in different areas. Kind of like doing a review. First, try to summarize the paper. Next, was the scientific objective clear? They did answer the main question? Then, given the nature of my Ph.D. program, <span>I think that I should try to comment on any statistics used in the papers. This certainly includes the plots and reproducibility. If they included tools (software), I could take a quick look at it. Then, I can end with stating the main things I liked. Maybe I could come up with some scoring mechanism to rate the paper.</span></p>
<p><span>You can think of other aspects to talk about of a paper. For example, in what way did it help it&#8217;s field? But, I don&#8217;t think that I can answer this for many papers outside my research area. It would all be speculation. I guess that I could use Google Scholar to see who cited the paper and maybe comment on it&#8217;s impact that way. For the LCG papers, I could point out how the LCG students contributed. </span></p>
<p><span>Or maybe I could take the more educational route. But that&#8217;s very time consuming as I can see from <a href="http://cienciaexplicada.blogspot.com/">La Ciencia explicada</a>'s highly detailed posts.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyhow, if I have something clear in mind is how I would implement it. I&#8217;m thinking of making a GitHub repository and writing my comments using Rmd and knitr. Then posting them here using Markdown. It should be easy to then have a template post and fill in the gaps after reading the paper.</span></p>
<p><span>The risk of using a template is that the comments will start to look boring. That&#8217;s why I might add a more free section, or change things up a bit.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any ideas, let me know!</span></p>
