<p>Sometime last week I was skimming through the Research Blogging feed when <a href="http://trynerdy.com/?p=1664">Why protein keeps you more alert (and thinner) than sugar does</a> caught my attention. This semester I&#8217;ve been struggling through my Immunology course and I think that&#8217;s because I normally eat breakfast a few minutes before. That doesn&#8217;t happen the other days of the week because I take a shuttle and I get sleepy there and not in class. So, the claim from this post surely made sense in my mind. However, as noted in the comments on original post, the answer is more complicated and is not a <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> option. Balance is the key, but I do think that I have to shift my current balance by reducing my sugar intake in breakfasts. Ahh, but that orange juice is great!</p>
<p>Anyhow, it&#8217;s good to understand at some level the reason why sugar makes you sleepy.</p>
