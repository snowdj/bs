Well, on the Occupational Digest blog they commented a paper where they found that the best predictor is programming knowledge. This is acquired through years of practice and makes sense. After all, even if you are a gifted person for something, if you don&#8217;t practice and learn from others you won&#8217;t get anywhere. So, welcome to school for life! :P</p>
