<p>I have decided that it&#8217;s in my best interests to separate my academic posts from my personal ones. Thus, I have moved the posts I considered to be personal to my new blog, <a href="http://fellger.tumblr.com/">Fellger Byte</a>. I like the name since it goes along with <a href="http://fellgernon.tumblr.com/">Fellgernon Bit</a>, plus it involves mostly cooking posts.</p>
<p>Fellgernon Bit will continue to have it&#8217;s posts linked on twitter and on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FellgernonBit">Fellgernon Bit facebook page</a>. By the way, I&#8217;m considering turning off my auto-post to facebook from twitter option. Yet I think that most of my friends find the new posts through my personal facebook and not the Fellgernon Bit fb page.</p>
<p>In constrast, posts at Fellger Byte will not be publicized beyond my personal facebook account. Also, posts will not appear on twitter. You can subscribe to it via RSS or email which is something I enabled for family and friends to &#8216;follow&#8217; it. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t plan on posting stuff that is more personal in Fellger Byte than what I used to post here— maybe a little bit. But still, I think that it will be good to separate them. Also, I do think that Fellger Byte will turn into a bilingual blog to practice my Spanish —for some topics Spanish might be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Right now Fellger Byte has 40 posts while Fellgernon Bit has 78 (79 with this one). I took advantage of this re-arrangement of my posts to edit the tags on most of them. I cleaned them up by using the same letter cases; for example, &#8216;Blog&#8217; and &#8216;blog&#8217; are now only &#8216;Blog&#8217;. It looks at lot cleaner, right?</p>

<p>This is the tag cloud at the other blog, which is mostly about my cooking, GSL, and Shoulder topics.</p>

<p>With this separation, I&#8217;ll add a link to my academic blog in my academic email signature. That&#8217;s something I have been looking forward to.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, my goal is to &#8220;brand&#8221; my academic name via Fellgernon Bit and twitter while still sharing with friends and family some of my life events via Fellger Byte.</p>
<p>See you around!</p>
<p>PS I also increased the width from 800px to 1000px (520px for posts to 720px) since I frequently have long text posts and I now want to include R code. Also, I limited the number of posts from 10 to 5 per page to decrease load times. Finally, I removed some of the &#8220;share&#8221; buttons and the twitter feed that were making things a bit slow.</p>
