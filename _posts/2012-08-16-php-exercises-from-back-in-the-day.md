<p>I recently received a request to share the code for the PHP exercises I published atÂ <a href="http://www.lcg.unam.mx/~lcollado/exercices.php"><a href="http://www.lcg.unam.mx/~lcollado/exercices.php">http://www.lcg.unam.mx/~lcollado/exercices.php</a></a> as part of my Computation II homework. I just uploaded them <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/lcg/lcg_php_lcollado.zip">here</a> and I included the index.php and index_en.php files for my LCG website. If you want, you can download these two directly from the LCG website (they might even be newer versions).</p>
<p>If you upload the PHP exercises to your server they should work. These were pretty straight forward and basic exercises and the instructions are listed on every one of them (in Spanish though). I remember using a site listing PHP commands to do them.</p>
<p>Hopefully the person who requested them will find them to be useful. Cheers!</p>
