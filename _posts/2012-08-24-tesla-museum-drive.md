<p>This is just amazing! I&#8217;m amazed at how fast The Oatmeal and others managed to raise the money to buy Tesla&#8217;s laboratory (well, hopefully they&#8217;ll outbid the retail store). With many days left on the donation drive it&#8217;d be amazing if they can also get the $$ to at least open a small portion as a museum in the near future. Anyhow, if you don&#8217;t know about this <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/tesla_museum_1m">go here and learn more!</a></p>
