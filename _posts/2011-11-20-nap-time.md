<p>Quickly browsing through some recent papers in PLoS I found a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action;jsessionid=1E010112BAF8020FE9C25D5E43B92147?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0027139">paper</a> where they found that naps make it easier to understand abstract concepts. That sounds great and at the same time it isn&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t have time to take naps every time I&#8217;m trying to understand an abstract concept. But well, it&#8217;s nice to imagine a world where you have a nap time in class instead of breaks just so you can make it easier on your brain to understand what is going on. Just imagine people going to class with their notebook and a pillow!</p>
<p>That&#8217;d be hilarious!</p>
