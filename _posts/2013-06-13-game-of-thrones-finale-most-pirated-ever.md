<p>I was rather entertained by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/22853888">Game of Thrones finale most pirated ever on BitTorrents</a> written by Del Crookes. With that title, I thought that the news was going to have a strong anti-piracy tone. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, this point of view is covered in the story with quotes from the actor of Jamie Lanister such as:</p>

> <p>At the end of the day it&#8217;s stealing. I know it doesn&#8217;t feel like it but it is and it&#8217;s not right.</p>

<p>But I am happy to see comments from HBO programming president who said:</p>

> <p><span>The demand is there. And it certainly didn&#8217;t negatively impact the DVD sales. [Piracy is] something that comes along with having a wildly successful show on a subscription network.</span></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that there is a black and white picture to piracy and like to see this reflected on the previous comment. Sure, there are aspects of piracy that hurt the industry and can lead to mafia-gangs that control the sales of the pirate DVDs: you don&#8217;t see this much in the US but it&#8217;s very common in México. But piracy can help promote material, make it more widely known, and eventually lead to an increase in sales (assuming the product is not overpriced).</p>
<p>Anyhow, the debate can be quite long and I just wanted to present a tiny piece of it.</p>
