<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy to announce that I have completed my personal academic website at <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/index.html#.UDKHKtCe5Ls"><a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/">http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/</a></a> I had uploaded a first version last week, but over the weekend I completed it. I finally uploaded the slides for many of the courses that I taught over the years in Mexico. These were mostly R/Bioconductor courses and the slides sometimes are in Spanish and other times in English. I added country flags to make it clear for the visitors what they&#8217;ll find. There certainly were more slides to share than what I had thought! You&#8217;ll find them under the <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/teaching.html#.UDKI0tCe5Ls">Teaching tab</a> which will direct you to the course-specific sites such as the <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/PDCB-HTS.html#.UDKI_NCe5Ls">High-Throughput Sequencing Analysis with Bioconductor</a> PDCB course. </p>
<p>Maybe because I don&#8217;t have many published papers, but I added the presentations and posters I&#8217;ve made under the <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/publications.html#.UDKJqtCe5Ls">Publications tab</a>. This was way easier to do compared to the courses pages.</p>
<p>The last bit that I had to do was update my CV. It hasn&#8217;t changed much, but I did modify the presentation and the way it was written. I also copied <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hiparker/CV/">Hilary Parker&#8217;s site</a> by embedding <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/cv.html#.UDKJi9Ce5Ls">my CV</a> in it using the Google code for it: <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer"><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer">https://docs.google.com/viewer</a></a>. For the whole process I kept checking how <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~afrazee/">Alyssa Frazee</a>, <a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/">Rafael Irizarry</a>, <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/">Jeffrey Leek</a> and <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hiparker/">Hilary</a>'s sites. From what I've heard, everyone gets some inspiration from their peers websites.</p>
<p>Anyhow, check it out and let me know what you think! Specially if you find any typos and mistakes.</p>
