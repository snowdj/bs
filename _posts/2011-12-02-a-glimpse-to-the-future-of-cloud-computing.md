<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/cloud-computing-endangers-older-tech-companies">A glimpse to the future of cloud computing</a><br/><p>I recently read the post on <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/cloud-computing-endangers-older-tech-companies">Cloud Computing as a Threat to Older Tech Companies</a> by Quentin Hardy and found it an interesting read. Sure, we all knew that Google is eating up a piece of Apple&#8217;s market with Android and that they are going to be around in 2013. But then, I didn&#8217;t know that China is projected to beat Japan in technology consumption that soon. Overall, this post includes several curious details and a brief recap of the history of the field.</p>
<p>So, which third of Google, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Intel, SAP, RIM, Oracle, Cisco, Dell do you think will fade out?</p>
