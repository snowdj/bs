<p>I&#8217;m in the process of cleaning my email inbox, after all I ignored many emails while I was studying for the comprehensive exam and enjoying the summer vacations. A good friend of mine sent me the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22594909">"Goodbye, Columbus" commentary by Gregory Petsko</a>. It is about a hypothetical conversation between queen Isabella, king Ferdinand and captain Columbus in 1492. Columbus shows up at a royal hearing to appeal the decision to fund his exploration travels. Isabella and Ferdinand are like current administrators and use several arguments, some based on the peer-review system, to justify their decision. It&#8217;s so funny that I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing for a while. But well, the message is a criticism against current funding policies. It&#8217;s a two page short commentary, and I highly recommend reading it!</p>
