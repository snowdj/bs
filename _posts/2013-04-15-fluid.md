<p>While I was looking for a Google Tasks app for the Mac, I found the following <a href="http://www.quora.com/OS-X-Applications/What-is-the-best-way-to-manage-Google-Tasks-on-Mac-OS-X">Quora thread</a> where Dave Thompson suggests trying out <a href="http://www.fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s free and super simple to use and with it I create apps for some of the sites that I visit frequently like Gmail. <br/><br/>One advantage I see is that I can now look on a specific desktop my Gmail (right now I&#8217;m using 8) and help me organize my work. Otherwise, whenever I open Google Chrome I have to manually move each window to the desktop I want it to be in. <span>The other way of doing this is by using separate browsers for different pages, but then if you want to find something in your browsing history it becomes a mess. Plus, I like the idea of having a tab-less window for Gmail. The cherry on the pie is that you choose your favorite icon for each application.</span></p>
<p>To illustrate how I separate things, my desktops are currently organized like this:</p>
<ol><li>Miscellaneous browsing, reading, etc.</li>
<li>Homework (either Statistical Theory or Probability Theory)</li>
<li>Methods (see #jhsph753)</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Comprehensive exam studying</li>
<li>Gmail, Google Reader, Calendar and Twitter</li>
<li>Tumblr, facebook, &#8230;</li>
</ol><p>Without Fluid, that involves moving many browser windows around.</p>
