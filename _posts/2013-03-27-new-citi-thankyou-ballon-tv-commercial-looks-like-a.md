<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I think that this new &#8220;Citi ThankYou Cards&#8221; TV commercial is trying to ride the popularity train from the &#8220;HELLO KITTY IN SPACE&#8221; video.</p>

<p>Hm&#8230; it looks like a ripoff, smells like a ripoff, tastes like a ripoff&#8230; is it a ripoff?</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just flattery, maybe it&#8217;s imitation, or maybe it&#8217;s copyrightÂ infringement. What do you think?</p>
