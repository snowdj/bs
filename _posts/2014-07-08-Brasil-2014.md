If you wanted to know why I've been absent, well, that's because I went on a couple of trips the past few weeks. Out of 23 days I spent 8 of them inside an airplane --- at least for a few hours. I won't write about all my vacations here, but the major highlight was going to Brazil for the Mexico vs Croatia group stage match.

## Recife Antigo

The match was held at [Recife](https://www.google.com/search?q=recife%20brazil&gws_rd=ssl) which is in the Northeast of Brazil. There are quite a few things particular to this city, but I'll just focus on [Recife Antigo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife_Antigo). It's an island where old town Recife is located and held the main party attractions. You could easily go from the FIFA Fan Fest to Rua da Moeda and finally to the big dancing platform set up for the occasion. The FIFA Fan Fest had the large screen for watching games and all the official sponsors had booths there: my favorite, the one selling beer! A few blocks away was Rua da Moeda where many local bars were open at night and tons of people would go there. There was a relatively small stage set up too where one night they were playing Brazilian rock. After a few blocks packed with people and some food vendors you could get to a square where the local government had set up a large wooden platform and live musicians got you dancing.

## Before match day


The pair of nights before the game were our most party-intense nights covering all three areas of Recife Antigo I describe earlier. As the match got closer, you could see tons of mexicans gathering at the FIFA Fan Fest. After all, you can say that at the FIFA Fan Fest it was around 60% tourists, then around 50% tourists at Rua da Moeda and finally like 10-20% at the dancing platform. I liked this since you could hang out with very different crowds.

As proof that mexicans were dominating the tourist portion, one of the popular chants was _¡Y ya lo ves, y ya lo ves, somos locales otra vez!_ as shown in the video below. Mexicans would find the few pockets of croatian tourists and sign next to them.

## Mexico's national anthem

I took plenty of other short videos, but the main ones are from the match. Here is one where we sign the mexican national anthem before the start of the match. To feel it's power you really need to turn up the volume in your speakers/headphones.

## Mexico scores

My video taking abilities are not top notch, and thankfully I don't do this for a living! Otherwise I would probably be without a job now haha. But I did get a live shot of Mexico's first goal in the match and the ensuing celebration =) Just ignore my finger's cameo appearance.

## Exhausted


After getting 4 hours before the match, signing all day long (even on the subway -- sorry locals!) and jumping a lot, we were exhausted when we got back to the hotel. As proof, look at my brother defeated by a crêpe (and some [caipirinhas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha) ^^).

The trip was totally worth it and I would do it again if I could. Problem is that at the current rate, the next World Cup in Brazil will be 64 years from now in 2078. Hm..., I'm not sure I'll be alive then. Qatar 2022? Haha! Nope! Russia 2018? Hm... tempting. 

All I know is that I need to keep saving some pennies for the next big trip!!
