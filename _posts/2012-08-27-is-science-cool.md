<p>Adam Ruben shares his answer to whether science is cool or not. Since &#8220;cool&#8221; depends on the current trends, this question is set on the recent landing of Curiosity. It&#8217;s the landrover that recently landed on Mars and has been sending some pictures back. </p>
<p>Anyhow, check his answer <a href="http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2012_08_24/caredit.a1200095">here</a>. I liked this part:</p>
> <p><span>If the Mars landing draws students to science, it won’t be because they witnessed science doing something cool. It’ll be because they witnessed science doing something human, something genuine, something legitimately appealing on its own merits. Something scientific.</span></p>
